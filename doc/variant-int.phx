*variant_int*

(PHP 5, PHP 7, PHP 8)

variant_int â€” Returns the integer portion of a variant

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  variant_int(mixed $value): variant~

Gets the integer portion of a variant.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{value}

  The variant.

  Note:

  As with all the variant arithmetic functions, the parameters for this
  function can be either a PHP native type (integer, string, floating point,
  boolean or null), or an instance of a COM, VARIANT or DOTNET class. PHP
  native types will be converted to variants using the same rules as found in
  the constructor for the variant class. COM and DOTNET objects will have the
  value of their default property taken and used as the variant value.

  The variant arithmetic functions are wrappers around the similarly named
  functions in the COM library; for more information on these functions,
  consult the MSDN library. The PHP functions are named slightly differently;
  for example |variant_add| in PHP corresponds to VarAdd() in the MSDN
  documentation.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

If {value} is negative, then the first negative integer less than or equal to
the variant is returned, otherwise returns the integer portion of the value of
{value}.

===============================================================================
[ Errors/Exceptions ]

Throws a com_exception on failure.
