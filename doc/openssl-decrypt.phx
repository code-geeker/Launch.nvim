openssl_decrypt â€” Decrypts data

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  openssl_decrypt(    string~
  $data,    string~
  $cipher_algo,    #[\SensitiveParameter] string~
  $passphrase,    int $options =~
  0,    string $iv =~
  "",    ?string $tag =~
  null,    string $aad = ""): string|false~

Takes a raw or base64 encoded string and decrypts it using a given method and
passphrase.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{data}

  The encrypted message to be decrypted.

{cipher_algo}

  The cipher method. For a list of available cipher methods, use 
  |openssl_get_cipher_methods|.

{passphrase}

  The passphrase. If the passphrase is shorter than expected, it is silently
  padded with NUL characters; if the passphrase is longer than expected, it is
  silently truncated.

  Caution

  There is no key derivation function used for {passphrase} as its name might
  suggest. The only operation used is padding with NUL characters or truncation
  if the length is different than expected.

{options}

  {options} can be one of OPENSSL_RAW_DATA, OPENSSL_ZERO_PADDING or
  OPENSSL_DONT_ZERO_PAD_KEY.

{iv}

  A non-null Initialization Vector. If the IV is shorter than expected, it is
  padded with NUL characters and warning is emitted; if the passphrase is
  longer than expected, it is truncated and warning is emitted.

{tag}

  The authentication tag in AEAD cipher mode. If it is incorrect, the
  authentication fails and the function returns false.

  Caution

  The length of the {tag} is not checked by the function. It is the caller's
  responsibility to ensure that the length of the tag matches the length of the
  tag retrieved when |openssl_encrypt| has been called. Otherwise the
  decryption may succeed if the given tag only matches the start of the proper
  tag.

{aad}

  Additional authenticated data.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

The decrypted string on success or false on failure.

===============================================================================
[ Errors/Exceptions ]

Emits an E_WARNING level error if an unknown cipher algorithm is passed via the
{cipher_algo} parameter.

Emits an E_WARNING level error if an empty value is passed in via the {iv}
parameter.

===============================================================================
[ Changelog ]

Version                Description
8.1.0   {tag} is now nullable.
7.1.0   The {tag} and {aad} parameters were added.
