*ldap_read*

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7, PHP 8)

ldap_read â€” Read an entry

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  ldap_read(    LDAP\Connection|array~
  $ldap,    array|string~
  $base,    array|string~
  $filter,    array $attributes =~
  [],    int $attributes_only =~
  0,    int $sizelimit = -1,    int~
  $timelimit = -1,    int $deref =~
  LDAP_DEREF_NEVER,    ?array $controls = null):~
  LDAP\Result|array|false~

Performs the search for a specified {filter} on the directory with the scope
LDAP_SCOPE_BASE. So it is equivalent to reading an entry from the directory.

It is also possible to perform parallel searches. In this case, the first
argument should be an array of LDAP\Connection instances, rather than a single
one. If the searches should not all use the same base DN and filter, an array
of base DNs and/or an array of filters can be passed as arguments instead.
These arrays must be of the same size as the LDAP\Connection instances array,
since the first entries of the arrays are used for one search, the second
entries are used for another, and so on. When doing parallel searches an array
of LDAP\Result instances is returned, except in case of error, when the return
value will be false.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{ldap}

  An LDAP\Connection instance, returned by |ldap_connect|.

{base}

  The base DN for the directory.

{filter}

  An empty filter is not allowed. If you want to retrieve absolutely all
  information for this entry, use a filter of objectClass=*. If you know which
  entry types are used on the directory server, you might use an appropriate
  filter such as objectClass=inetOrgPerson.

{attributes}

  An array of the required attributes, e.g. array("mail", "sn", "cn"). Note
  that the "dn" is always returned irrespective of which attributes types are
  requested.

  Using this parameter is much more efficient than the default action (which is
  to return all attributes and their associated values). The use of this
  parameter should therefore be considered good practice.

{attributes_only}

  Should be set to 1 if only attribute types are wanted. If set to 0 both
  attributes types and attribute values are fetched which is the default
  behaviour.

{sizelimit}

  Enables you to limit the count of entries fetched. Setting this to 0 means no
  limit.

    Note:

    This parameter can NOT override server-side preset sizelimit. You can set
    it lower though.

    Some directory server hosts will be configured to return no more than a
    preset number of entries. If this occurs, the server will indicate that it
    has only returned a partial results set. This also occurs if you use this
    parameter to limit the count of fetched entries.

{timelimit}

  Sets the number of seconds how long is spend on the search. Setting this to 0
  means no limit.

    Note:

    This parameter can NOT override server-side preset timelimit. You can set
    it lower though.

{deref}

  Specifies how aliases should be handled during the search. It can be one of
  the following:
   + LDAP_DEREF_NEVER - (default) aliases are never dereferenced.
   + LDAP_DEREF_SEARCHING - aliases should be dereferenced during the search
    but not when locating the base object of the search.
   + LDAP_DEREF_FINDING - aliases should be dereferenced when locating the base
    object but not during the search.
   + LDAP_DEREF_ALWAYS - aliases should be dereferenced always.

{controls}

  Array of LDAP Controls to send with the request.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

Returns an LDAP\Result instance, an array of LDAP\Result instances, or false on
failure.
