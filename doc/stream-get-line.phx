*stream_get_line*

(PHP 5, PHP 7, PHP 8)

stream_get_line â€” Gets line from stream resource up to a given delimiter

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  stream_get_line(resource $stream, int $length, string $ending =~
  ""): string|false~

Gets a line from the given handle.

Reading ends when {length} bytes have been read, when the non-empty string
specified by {ending} is found (which is not included in the return value), or
on EOF (whichever comes first).

This function is nearly identical to |fgets| except in that it allows end of
line delimiters other than the standard \n, \r, and \r\n, and does not return
the delimiter itself.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{stream}

  A valid file handle.

{length}

  The maximum number of bytes to read from the handle. Negative values are not
  supported. Zero (0) means the default socket chunk size, i.e. 8192 bytes.

{ending}

  An optional string delimiter.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

Returns a string of up to {length} bytes read from the file pointed to by
{stream}, or false on failure.
