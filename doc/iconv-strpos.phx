*iconv_strpos*

(PHP 5, PHP 7, PHP 8)

iconv_strpos â€” Finds position of first occurrence of a needle within a haystack

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  iconv_strpos(    string~
  $haystack,    string $needle,    int~
  $offset = 0,    ?string $encoding = null): int|false~

Finds position of first occurrence of a {needle} within a {haystack}.

In contrast to |strpos|, the return value of iconv_strpos() is the number of
characters that appear before the needle, rather than the offset in bytes to
the position where the needle has been found. The characters are counted on the
basis of the specified character set {encoding}.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{haystack}

  The entire string.

{needle}

  The searched substring.

{offset}

  The optional {offset} parameter specifies the position from which the search
  should be performed. If the offset is negative, it is counted from the end of
  the string.

{encoding}

  If {encoding} parameter is omitted or null, {string} are assumed to be
  encoded in iconv.internal_encoding.

If {haystack} or {needle} is not a string, it is converted to a string and
applied as the ordinal value of a character.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

Returns the numeric position of the first occurrence of {needle} in {haystack}.

If {needle} is not found, iconv_strpos() will return false.

Warning

This function may return Boolean false, but may also return a non-Boolean value
which evaluates to false. Please read the section on Booleans for more
information. Use the === operator for testing the return value of this
function.
