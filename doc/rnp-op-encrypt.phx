===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{ffi}

  The FFI object returned by rnp_ffi_create.

{recipient_keys_fp}

  Array with fingerprints of recipient's keys. At least one key must be
  present.

{options}

  An associative array with options.

          Key          Data                      Description
                       type
                              Compression algorithm. Both "compression_alg" and
  "compression_alg"   string  "compression_level" must be set in order to
                              enable data compression.
  "compression_level" integer Compression level, 0-9. 0 disables compression.
  "armor"             boolean Enable ASCII-armored output. Disabled by default.
  "add_signature"     boolean Encrypted message will be also signed.
                              Set hash algorithm used during signature
  "hash"              string  calculation. "add_signature" option should be set
                              to true
  "creation_time"     integer Set signature creation time in seconds since Jan,
                              1 1970 UTC. By default current time is used.
                              Set signature expiration time in seconds since
  "expiration_time"   integer the creation time. 0 value is used to mark
                              signature as non-expiring (default value).
  "password"          string  Add password which is used to encrypt data.
                              Set symmetric encryption algorithm. Possible
                              values are "IDEA", "TRIPLEDES", "CAST5",
  "cipher"            string  "BLOWFISH", "AES128", "AES192", "AES256",
                              "TWOFISH", "CAMELLIA128", "CAMELLIA192",
                              "CAMELLIA256", "SM4".
  "aead"              string  Set AEAD mode algorithm. Possible values are
                              "None" to disable AEAD, "EAX", "OCB".
  "aead_bits"         integer Set chunk length for AEAD mode via number of
                              chunk size bits. Must be between 0 to 56.
                              Set additional encryption flags. Supported flags:
  "flags"             integer RNP_ENCRYPT_NOWRAP - do not wrap the data in a
                              literal data packet. This would allow to encrypt
                              already signed data.
                              Set the internally stored file name for the data
                              being encrypted. Special value _CONSOLE may be
  "file_name"         string  used to mark message as 'for your eyes only',
                              i.e. it should not be stored anywhere but only
                              displayed to the receiver. Default is the empty
                              string.
  "file_mtime"        integer Set input file modification date in seconds since
                              Jan, 1 1970 UTC.

[ Return Values ]

Encrypted data on success or false on failure.
