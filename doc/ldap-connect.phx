*ldap_connect*

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7, PHP 8)

ldap_connect â€” Connect to an LDAP server

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  ldap_connect(?string $uri = null): LDAP\Connection|false~
Warning

As of PHP 8.3.0, the following signature is deprecated.

  ldap_connect(?string $host = null, int $port = 389): LDAP\Connection|false~

Creates an LDAP\Connection connection and checks whether the given {uri} is
plausible.

  Note: This function does not open a connection. It checks whether the given
  parameters are plausible and can be used to open a connection as soon as one
  is needed.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{uri}

  A full LDAP URI of the form ldap://hostname:port or ldaps://hostname:port for
  SSL encryption.

  You can also provide multiple LDAP-URIs separated by a space as one string

  Note that hostname:port is not a supported LDAP URI as the schema is missing.

{host}

  The hostname to connect to.

{port}

  The port to connect to.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

Returns an LDAP\Connection instance when the provided LDAP URI seems plausible.
It's a syntactic check of the provided parameter but the server(s) will not be
contacted! If the syntactic check fails it returns false. ldap_connect() will
otherwise return a LDAP\Connection instance as it does not actually connect but
just initializes the connecting parameters. The actual connect happens with the
next calls to ldap_* functions, usually with |ldap_bind|.

If no argument is specified then the LDAP\Connection instance of the already
opened connection will be returned.
