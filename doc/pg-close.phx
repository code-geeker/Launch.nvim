*pg_close*

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7, PHP 8)

pg_close â€” Closes a PostgreSQL connection

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  pg_close(?PgSql\Connection $connection = null): true~

pg_close() closes the non-persistent connection to a PostgreSQL database
associated with the given {connection} instance.

  Note:

  Using pg_close() is not usually necessary, as non-persistent open connections
  are automatically closed at the end of the script.

If there is open PgSql\Lob instance on the connection, do not close the
connection before closing all PgSql\Lob instances.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{connection}

  An PgSql\Connection instance. When {connection} is null, the default
  connection is used. The default connection is the last connection made by 
  |pg_connect| or |pg_pconnect|.
  Warning

  As of PHP 8.1.0, using the default connection is deprecated.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

Always returns true.
