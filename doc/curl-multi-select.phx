*curl_multi_select*

(PHP 5, PHP 7, PHP 8)

curl_multi_select â€” Wait until reading or writing is possible for any cURL
multi handle connection

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  curl_multi_select(CurlMultiHandle $multi_handle, float $timeout = 1.0): int~

Blocks the execution of the script until a cURL handle attached to the cURL
multi handle would be able to make progress on the next call to 
|curl_multi_exec| or until the timeout strikes (whichever comes first).

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{multi_handle}

  A cURL multi handle returned by |curl_multi_init|.

{timeout}

  Time, in seconds, to wait for a response from the active cURL multi handle
  connections.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

On success, returns the number of active descriptors contained in the
descriptor sets. This may be 0 if there was no activity on any of the
descriptors. On failure, this function will return -1 on a select failure (from
the underlying select() system call).

===============================================================================
[ Errors/Exceptions ]

Throws a ValueError if {timeout} is less than 0 or greater than PHP_INT_MAX.
