*spl_object_hash*

(PHP 5 >= 5.2.0, PHP 7, PHP 8)

spl_object_hash â€” Return hash id for given object

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  spl_object_hash(object $object): string~

This function returns a unique identifier for the object. This id can be used
as a hash key for storing objects, or for identifying an object, as long as the
object is not destroyed. Once the object is destroyed, its hash may be reused
for other objects. This behavior is similar to |spl_object_id|.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{object}

  Any object.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

A string that is unique for each currently existing object and is always the
same for each object.

===============================================================================
[ Examples ]

Example #1 A spl_object_hash() example

<?php >
  $id = spl_object_hash($object);
  $storage[$id] = $object;
<?>

===============================================================================
[ Notes ]

  Note:

  When an object is destroyed, its hash may be reused for other objects.

  Note:

  Object hashes should be compared for identity with === and !==, because the
  returned hash could be a numeric string. For example:
  0000000000000e600000000000000000.
