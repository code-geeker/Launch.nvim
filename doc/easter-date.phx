*easter_date*

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7, PHP 8)

easter_date â€” Get Unix timestamp for local midnight on Easter of a given year

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  easter_date(?int $year = null, int $mode = CAL_EASTER_DEFAULT): int~

Returns the Unix timestamp corresponding to midnight on Easter of the given
year.

The date of Easter Day was defined by the Council of Nicaea in AD325 as the
Sunday after the first full moon which falls on or after the Spring Equinox.
The Equinox is assumed to always fall on 21st March, so the calculation reduces
to determining the date of the full moon and the date of the following Sunday.
The algorithm used here was introduced around the year 532 by Dionysius
Exiguus. Under the Julian Calendar (for years before 1753) a simple 19-year
cycle is used to track the phases of the Moon. Under the Gregorian Calendar
(for years after 1753 - devised by Clavius and Lilius, and introduced by Pope
Gregory XIII in October 1582, and into Britain and its then colonies in
September 1752) two correction factors are added to make the cycle more
accurate.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{year}

  The year must be a number between 1970 and 2037 for 32-bit systems, or
  between 1970 and 2,000,000,000 for 64-bit systems. If omitted or null,
  defaults to the current year according to the local time.

{mode}

  Allows Easter dates to be calculated based on the Julian calendar when set to
  CAL_EASTER_ALWAYS_JULIAN. See also calendar constants.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

The easter date as a unix timestamp.

===============================================================================
[ Errors/Exceptions ]

A ValueError is thrown if the year is earlier than 1970 or later than 2037 when
running on a 32-bit system, or later than 2,000,000,000 on a 64-bit system.

[ Changelog ]

Version                               Description
8.3.0   On 64-bit systems, the {year} parameter now accepts values within the
        range of 1970 to 2,000,000,000.
8.0.0   {year} is nullable now.
8.0.0   A ValueError is now thrown when {year} is outside the allowed range.
        Previously, an E_WARNING was raised and the function returned false.

[ Examples ]

Example #1 easter_date() example

<?php >

  echo date("M-d-Y", easter_date(1999)); // Apr-04-1999
  echo date("M-d-Y", easter_date(2000)); // Apr-23-2000
  echo date("M-d-Y", easter_date(2001)); // Apr-15-2001

<?>

Example #2 Using easter_date() with DateTime

<?php >

  $timestamp = easter_date(2023);

  $datetime = new \DateTime();
  $datetime->setTimestamp($timestamp);

  echo $datetime->format('M-d-Y'); // Apr-09-2023

<?>

===============================================================================
[ Notes ]

  Note:

  easter_date() relies on your system's C library time functions, rather than
  using PHP's internal date and time functions. As a consequence, easter_date()
  uses the TZ environment variable to determine the time zone it should operate
  in, rather than using PHP's default time zone, which may result in unexpected
  behaviour when using this function in conjunction with other date functions
  in PHP.

  As a workaround, you can use the |easter_days| with DateTime and DateInterval
  to calculate the start of Easter in your PHP time zone as follows:

  <?php >
  function get_easter_datetime($year) {
  $base = new DateTime("$year-03-21");
  $days = easter_days($year);

  return $base->add(new DateInterval("P{$days}D"));
  }

  foreach (range(2012, 2015) as $year) {
  printf("Easter in %d is on %s\n",
  $year,
  get_easter_datetime($year)->format('F j'));
  }
<  ?>

  The above example will output:

  Easter in 2012 is on April 8
  Easter in 2013 is on March 31
  Easter in 2014 is on April 20
  Easter in 2015 is on April 5
