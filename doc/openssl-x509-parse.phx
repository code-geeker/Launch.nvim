openssl_x509_parse â€” Parse an X509 certificate and return the information as an
array

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  openssl_x509_parse(OpenSSLCertificate|string $certificate, bool $short_names~
  = true): array|false~

openssl_x509_parse() returns information about the supplied {certificate},
including fields such as subject name, issuer name, purposes, valid from and
valid to dates etc.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{certificate}

  X509 certificate. See Key/Certificate parameters for a list of valid values.

{short_names}

  {short_names} controls how the data is indexed in the array - if
  {short_names} is true (the default) then fields will be indexed with the
  short name form, otherwise, the long name form will be used - e.g.: CN is the
  shortname form of commonName.

The structure of the returned data is (deliberately) not yet documented, as it
is still subject to change.

        Parsing certificate with no seconds in UTCTime is no longer allowed for
