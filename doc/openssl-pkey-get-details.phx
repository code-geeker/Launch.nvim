  Resource holding the key.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

Returns an array with the key details on success or false on failure. Returned
array has indexes bits (number of bits), key (string representation of the
public key) and type (type of the key which is one of OPENSSL_KEYTYPE_RSA,
OPENSSL_KEYTYPE_DSA, OPENSSL_KEYTYPE_DH, OPENSSL_KEYTYPE_EC,
OPENSSL_KEYTYPE_X25519, OPENSSL_KEYTYPE_ED25519, OPENSSL_KEYTYPE_X448,
OPENSSL_KEYTYPE_ED448, or -1 meaning unknown).

Depending on the key type used, additional details may be returned. Note that
some elements may not always be available.

 * OPENSSL_KEYTYPE_RSA, an additional array key named "rsa", containing the key
  data is returned.

   Key              Description
  "n"    modulus
  "e"    public exponent
  "d"    private exponent
  "p"    prime 1
  "q"    prime 2
  "dmp1" exponent1, d mod (p-1)
  "dmq1" exponent2, d mod (q-1)
  "iqmp" coefficient, (inverse of q) mod p

 * OPENSSL_KEYTYPE_DSA, an additional array key named "dsa", containing the key
  data is returned.

     Key                Description
  "p"        prime number (public)
  "q"        160-bit subprime, q | p-1 (public)
  "g"        generator of subgroup (public)
  "priv_key" private key x
  "pub_key"  public key y = g^x

 * OPENSSL_KEYTYPE_DH, an additional array key named "dh", containing the key
  data is returned.

     Key            Description
  "p"        prime number (shared)
  "g"        generator of Z_p (shared)
  "priv_key" private DH value x
  "pub_key"  public DH value g^x

 * OPENSSL_KEYTYPE_X25519, OPENSSL_KEYTYPE_ED25519, OPENSSL_KEYTYPE_X448, or
  OPENSSL_KEYTYPE_ED448 an additional array key named "x25519", "ed25519",
  "x448", or "ed448" respectively, is returned, containing the key data.

     Key     Description
  "priv_key" private key
  "pub_key"  public key

[ Changelog ]

Version                               Description
8.4.0   Added support for Curve25519 and Curve448 based keys. Specifically the
        x25519, ed25519, x448 and ed448 fields have been introduced.
8.0.0   {key} accepts an OpenSSLAsymmetricKey now; previously, a resource of
        type OpenSSL key was accepted.
