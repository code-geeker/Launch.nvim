(PHP 4 >= 4.2.0, PHP 5, PHP 7, PHP 8)

pg_lo_import â€” Import a large object from file

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  pg_lo_import(PgSql\Connection $connection = ?, string $pathname, mixed~
  $object_id = ?): int~

pg_lo_import() creates a new large object in the database using a file on the
filesystem as its data source.

To use the large object interface, it is necessary to enclose it within a
transaction block.

  Note:

  This function used to be called pg_loimport().

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{connection}

  An PgSql\Connection instance. When {connection} is unspecified, the default
  connection is used. The default connection is the last connection made by 
  |pg_connect| or |pg_pconnect|.
  Warning

  As of PHP 8.1.0, using the default connection is deprecated.

{pathname}

  The full path and file name of the file on the client filesystem from which
  to read the large object data.

{object_id}

  If an {object_id} is given the function will try to create a large object
  with this id, else a free object id is assigned by the server. The parameter
  relies on functionality that first appeared in PostgreSQL 8.1.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

The OID of the newly created large object, or false on failure.
