*shmop_open*

(PHP 4 >= 4.0.4, PHP 5, PHP 7, PHP 8)

shmop_open â€” Create or open shared memory block

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  shmop_open(    int $key,    string~
  $mode,    int $permissions,    int~
  $size): Shmop|false~

shmop_open() can create or open a shared memory block.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{key}

  System's id for the shared memory block. Can be passed as a decimal or hex.

{mode}

  The flags that you can use:
   + "a" for access (sets SHM_RDONLY for shmat) use this flag when you need to
    open an existing shared memory segment for read only
   + "c" for create (sets IPC_CREATE) use this flag when you need to create a
    new shared memory segment or if a segment with the same key exists, try to
    open it for read and write
   + "w" for read & write access use this flag when you need to read and write
    to a shared memory segment, use this flag in most cases.
   + "n" create a new memory segment (sets IPC_CREATE|IPC_EXCL) use this flag
    when you want to create a new shared memory segment but if one already
    exists with the same flag, fail. This is useful for security purposes,
    using this you can prevent race condition exploits.

{permissions}

  The permissions that you wish to assign to your memory segment, those are the
  same as permission for a file. Permissions need to be passed in octal form,
  like for example 0644

{size}

  The size of the shared memory block you wish to create in bytes

  Note:

  Note: the 3rd and 4th should be entered as 0 if you are opening an existing
  memory segment.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

On success shmop_open() will return a Shmop instance that you can use to access
the shared memory segment you've created. false is returned on failure.

===============================================================================
[ Errors/Exceptions ]

If {mode} is invalid, or {size} is less than or equal to zero, a ValueError is
thrown. On other failures, E_WARNING is emitted.

[ Changelog ]

Version                               Description
8.0.0   On success, this function returns an Shmop instance now; previously, a 
        resource was returned.
        If {mode} is invalid, or {size} is less than or equal to zero, a 
8.0.0   ValueError is thrown; previously E_WARNING was emitted instead, and the
        function returned false.

===============================================================================
[ Examples ]

Example #1 Create a new shared memory block

<?php >
  $shm_key = ftok(__FILE__, 't');
  $shm_id = shmop_open($shm_key, "c", 0644, 100);
<?>

This example opened a shared memory block with a system id returned by |ftok|.
