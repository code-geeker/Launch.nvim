mb_strcut â€” Get part of string

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  mb_strcut(    string $string,    int~
  $start,    ?int $length =~
  null,    ?string $encoding = null): string~

mb_strcut() extracts a substring from a string similarly to |mb_substr|, but
operates on bytes instead of characters. If the cut position happens to be
between two bytes of a multi-byte character, the cut is performed starting from
the first byte of that character. This is also the difference to the |substr|
function, which would simply cut the string between the bytes and thus result
in a malformed byte sequence.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{string}

  The string being cut.

{start}

  If {start} is non-negative, the returned string will start at the {start}'th
  byte position in {string}, counting from zero. For instance, in the string
  'abcdef', the byte at position 0 is 'a', the byte at position 2 is 'c', and
  so forth.

  If {start} is negative, the returned string will start at the {start}'th byte
  counting back from the end of {string}. However, if the magnitude of a
  negative {start} is greater than the length of the string, the returned
  portion will start from the beginning of {string}.

{length}

  Length in bytes. If omitted or NULL is passed, extract all bytes to the end
  of the string.

  If {length} is negative, the returned string will end at the {length}'th byte
  counting back from the end of {string}. However, if the magnitude of a
  negative {length} is greater than the number of characters after the {start}
  position, an empty string will be returned.

{encoding}

  The {encoding} parameter is the character encoding. If it is omitted or null,
  the internal character encoding value will be used.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

mb_strcut() returns the portion of {string} specified by the {start} and
{length} parameters.
