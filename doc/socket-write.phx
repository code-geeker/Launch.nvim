*socket_write*

(PHP 4 >= 4.1.0, PHP 5, PHP 7, PHP 8)

socket_write â€” Write to a socket

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  socket_write(Socket $socket, string $data, ?int $length = null): int|false~

The function socket_write() writes to the {socket} from the given {data}.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{socket}

{data}

  The buffer to be written.

{length}

  The optional parameter {length} can specify an alternate length of bytes
  written to the socket. If this length is greater than the buffer length, it
  is silently truncated to the length of the buffer.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

Returns the number of bytes successfully written to the socket or false on
failure. The error code can be retrieved with |socket_last_error|. This code
may be passed to |socket_strerror| to get a textual explanation of the error.

  Note:

  It is perfectly valid for socket_write() to return zero which means no bytes
  have been written. Be sure to use the === operator to check for false in case
  of an error.

===============================================================================
[ Changelog ]

Version                            Description
8.0.0   {socket} is a Socket instance now; previously, it was a resource.
8.0.0   {length} is nullable now.

===============================================================================
[ Notes ]

  Note:

  socket_write() does not necessarily write all bytes from the given buffer.
  It's valid that, depending on the network buffers etc., only a certain amount
  of data, even one byte, is written though your buffer is greater. You have to
  watch out so you don't unintentionally forget to transmit the rest of your
  data.
