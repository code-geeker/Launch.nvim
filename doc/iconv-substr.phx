iconv_substr â€” Cut out part of a string

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  iconv_substr(    string~
  $string,    int $offset,    ?int~
  $length = null,    ?string $encoding = null):~
  string|false~

Cuts a portion of {string} specified by the {offset} and {length} parameters.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{string}

  The original string.

{offset}

  If {offset} is non-negative, iconv_substr() cuts the portion out of {string}
  beginning at {offset}'th character, counting from zero.

  If {offset} is negative, iconv_substr() cuts out the portion beginning at the
  position, {offset} characters away from the end of {string}.

{length}

  If {length} is given and is positive, the return value will contain at most
  {length} characters of the portion that begins at {offset} (depending on the
  length of {string}).

  If negative {length} is passed, iconv_substr() cuts the portion out of
  {string} from the {offset}'th character up to the character that is {length}
  characters away from the end of the string. In case {offset} is also
  negative, the start position is calculated beforehand according to the rule
  explained above.

{encoding}

  If {encoding} parameter is omitted or null, {string} are assumed to be
  encoded in iconv.internal_encoding.

  Note that {offset} and {length} parameters are always deemed to represent
  offsets that are calculated on the basis of the character set determined by
  {encoding}, whilst the counterpart |substr| always takes these for byte
  offsets.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

Returns the portion of {string} specified by the {offset} and {length}
parameters.

If {string} is shorter than {offset} characters long, false will be returned.
If {string} is exactly {offset} characters long, an empty string will be
returned.

===============================================================================
[ Changelog ]

Version                               Description
8.0.0   {length} and {encoding} are nullable now.
7.0.11  If {string} is equal to {offset} characters long, an empty string will
