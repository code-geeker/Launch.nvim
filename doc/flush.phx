*flush*

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7, PHP 8)

flush â€” Flush system output buffer

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  flush(): void~

Flushes the system write buffers of PHP and the backend used by PHP (e.g.: CGI,
a web server). In a command line environment flush() will attempt to flush the
contents of the buffers only whereas in a web context headers and the contents
of the buffers are flushed.

  Note: flush() may not be able to override the buffering scheme of the web
  server and it has no effect on any client-side buffering in the browser.

  Note: This function does not have any effect on user level output handlers
  such as those started by |ob_start| or |output_add_rewrite_var|.

Warning

flush() can interfere with output handlers that set and send headers in a web
context (e.g. |ob_gzhandler|) by sending headers before these handlers can do
so.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

This function has no parameters.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

No value is returned.
