*strspn*

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7, PHP 8)

strspn â€” Finds the length of the initial segment of a string consisting
entirely of characters contained within a given mask

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  strspn(    string $string,    string~
  $characters,    int $offset =~
  0,    ?int $length = null): int~

Finds the length of the initial segment of {string} that contains only
characters from {characters}.

If {offset} and {length} are omitted, then all of {string} will be examined. If
they are included, then the effect will be the same as calling strspn(substr
($string, $offset, $length), $characters) (see |substr| for more information).

The line of code:
<?php >
  $var = strspn("42 is the answer to the 128th question.", "1234567890");
<?>
will assign 2 to $var, because the string "42" is the initial segment of
{string} that consists only of characters contained within "1234567890".

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{string}

  The string to examine.

{characters}

  The list of allowable characters.

{offset}

  The position in {string} to start searching.

  If {offset} is given and is non-negative, then strspn() will begin examining
  {string} at the {offset}'th position. For instance, in the string 'abcdef',
  the character at position 0 is 'a', the character at position 2 is 'c', and
  so forth.

  If {offset} is given and is negative, then strspn() will begin examining
  {string} at the {offset}'th position from the end of {string}.

{length}

  The length of the segment from {string} to examine.

  If {length} is given and is non-negative, then {string} will be examined for
  {length} characters after the starting position.

  If {length} is given and is negative, then {string} will be examined from the
  starting position up to {length} characters from the end of {string}.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

Returns the length of the initial segment of {string} which consists entirely
of characters in {characters}.

  Note:

  When a {offset} parameter is set, the returned length is counted starting
  from this position, not from the beginning of {string}.

===============================================================================
[ Changelog ]

Version        Description
8.0.0   {length} is nullable now.

[ Examples ]

Example #1 strspn() example

<?php >
  // subject does not start with any characters from mask
  var_dump(strspn("foo", "o"));

  // examine two characters from subject starting at offset 1
  var_dump(strspn("foo", "o", 1, 2));

  // examine one character from subject starting at offset 1
  var_dump(strspn("foo", "o", 1, 1));
<?>

The above example will output:

int(0)
int(2)
int(1)
