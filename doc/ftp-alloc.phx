*ftp_alloc*

(PHP 5, PHP 7, PHP 8)

ftp_alloc â€” Allocates space for a file to be uploaded

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  ftp_alloc(FTP\Connection $ftp, int $size, string &$response = null): bool~

Sends an ALLO command to the remote FTP server to allocate space for a file to
be uploaded.

  Note:

  Many FTP servers do not support this command. These servers may return a
  failure code (false) indicating the command is not supported or a success
  code (true) to indicate that pre-allocation is not necessary and the client
  should continue as though the operation were successful. Because of this, it
  may be best to reserve this function for servers which explicitly require
  preallocation.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{ftp}

  An FTP\Connection instance.

{size}

  The number of bytes to allocate.

{response}

  A textual representation of the servers response will be returned by
  reference in {response} if a variable is provided.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

Returns true on success or false on failure.
