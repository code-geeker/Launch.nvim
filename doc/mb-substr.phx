mb_substr â€” Get part of string

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  mb_substr(    string $string,    int~
  $start,    ?int $length =~
  null,    ?string $encoding = null): string~

Performs a multi-byte safe |substr| operation based on number of characters.
Position is counted from the beginning of {string}. First character's position
is 0. Second character position is 1, and so on.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{string}

  The string to extract the substring from.

{start}

  If {start} is non-negative, the returned string will start at the {start}'th
  position in {string}, counting from zero. For instance, in the string
  'abcdef', the character at position 0 is 'a', the character at position 2 is
  'c', and so forth.

  If {start} is negative, the returned string will start at the {start}'th
  character from the end of {string}.

{length}

  Maximum number of characters to use from {string}. If omitted or NULL is
  passed, extract all characters to the end of the string.

{encoding}

  The {encoding} parameter is the character encoding. If it is omitted or null,
  the internal character encoding value will be used.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

mb_substr() returns the portion of {string} specified by the {start} and
{length} parameters.
