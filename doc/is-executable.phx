Tip

As of PHP 5.0.0, this function can also be used with some URL wrappers. Refer
to Supported Protocols and Wrappers to determine which wrappers support |stat|
family of functionality.

  Note: On Windows, a file is considered executable, if it is a properly
  executable file as reported by the Win API GetBinaryType(); for BC reasons,
  files with a .bat or .cmd extension are also considered executable. Prior to
  PHP 7.4.0, any non-empty file with a .exe or .com extension was considered
  executable. Note that PATHEXT is irrelevant for is_executable().
