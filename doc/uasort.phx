*uasort*

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7, PHP 8)

uasort â€” Sort an array with a user-defined comparison function and maintain
index association

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  uasort(array &$array, callable $callback): true~

Sorts {array} in place such that its keys maintain their correlation with the
values they are associated with, using a user-defined comparison function.

This is used mainly when sorting associative arrays where the actual element
order is significant.

  Note:

  If two members compare as equal, they retain their original order. Prior to
  PHP 8.0.0, their relative order in the sorted array was undefined.

  Note:

  Resets array's internal pointer to the first element.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{array}

  The input array.

{callback}

  The comparison function must return an integer less than, equal to, or
  greater than zero if the first argument is considered to be respectively less
  than, equal to, or greater than the second.


  callback(mixed $a, mixed $b): int~
  Caution

  Returning non-integer values from the comparison function, such as float,
  will result in an internal cast to int of the callback's return value. So
  values such as 0.99 and 0.1 will both be cast to an integer value of 0, which
  will compare such values as equal.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

Always returns true.

[ Changelog ]

Version                               Description
8.2.0   The return type is true now; previously, it was bool.
8.0.0   If {callback} expects a parameter to be passed by reference, this
        function will now emit an E_WARNING.

===============================================================================
[ Examples ]

Example #1 Basic uasort() example

<?php >
  // Comparison function
  function cmp($a, $b) {
  if ($a == $b) {
  return 0;
  }
  return ($a < $b) ? -1 : 1;
  }

  // Array to be sorted
  $array = array('a' => 4, 'b' => 8, 'c' => -1, 'd' => -9, 'e' => 2, 'f' => 5, 
  'g' => 3, 'h' => -4);
  print_r($array);

  // Sort and print the resulting array
  uasort($array, 'cmp');
  print_r($array);
<?>

The above example will output:

Array
(
    [a] => 4
    [b] => 8
    [c] => -1
    [d] => -9
    [e] => 2
    [f] => 5
    [g] => 3
    [h] => -4
)
Array
(
    [d] => -9
    [h] => -4
    [c] => -1
    [e] => 2
    [g] => 3
    [a] => 4
    [f] => 5
    [b] => 8
)
