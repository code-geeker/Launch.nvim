*strrchr*

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7, PHP 8)

strrchr â€” Find the last occurrence of a character in a string

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  strrchr(string $haystack, string $needle, bool $before_needle = false):~
  string|false~

This function returns the portion of {haystack} which starts at the last
occurrence of {needle} and goes until the end of {haystack}.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{haystack}

  The string to search in

{needle}

  If {needle} contains more than one character, only the first is used. This
  behavior is different from that of |strstr|.

  Prior to PHP 8.0.0, if {needle} is not a string, it is converted to an
  integer and applied as the ordinal value of a character. This behavior is
  deprecated as of PHP 7.3.0, and relying on it is highly discouraged.
  Depending on the intended behavior, the {needle} should either be explicitly
  cast to string, or an explicit call to |chr| should be performed.

{before_needle}

  If true, strrchr() returns the part of the {haystack} before the last
  occurrence of the {needle} (excluding the needle).

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

This function returns the portion of string, or false if {needle} is not found.

[ Changelog ]

Version                    Description
8.3.0   The {before_needle} parameter was added.
8.0.0   {needle} now accepts an empty string.
8.0.0   Passing an int as {needle} is no longer supported.
7.3.0   Passing an int as {needle} has been deprecated.

===============================================================================
[ Examples ]

Example #1 strrchr() example

<?php >
  $ext = strrchr('somefile.txt', '.');
  echo "file extension: $ext \n";
  $ext = $ext ? strtolower(substr($ext, 1)) : '';
  echo "file extension: $ext";
<?>

The above example will output something similar to:

file extension: .txt
file extension: txt

[ Notes ]

  Note: This function is binary-safe.
