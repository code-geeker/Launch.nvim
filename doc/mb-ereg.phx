mb_ereg â€” Regular expression match with multibyte support

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  mb_ereg(string $pattern, string $string, array &$matches = null): bool~

Executes the regular expression match with multibyte support.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{pattern}

  The search pattern.

{string}

  The search string.

{matches}

  If matches are found for parenthesized substrings of {pattern} and the
  function is called with the third argument {matches}, the matches will be
  stored in the elements of the array {matches}. If no matches are found,
  {matches} is set to an empty array.

  $matches[1] will contain the substring which starts at the first left
  parenthesis; $matches[2] will contain the substring starting at the second,
  and so on. $matches[0] will contain a copy of the complete string matched.

[ Changelog ]

Version                               Description
        This function returns true on success now. Previously, it returned the
        byte length of the matched string if a match for {pattern} was found in
8.0.0   {string} and {matches} was passed. If the optional parameter {matches}
        was not passed or the length of the matched string was 0, this function
        returned 1.
7.1.0   mb_ereg() will now set {matches} to an empty array, if nothing matched.
        Formerly, {matches} was not modified in that case.

===============================================================================
[ Notes ]

  Note:

  The internal encoding or the character encoding specified by 
  |mb_regex_encoding| will be used as the character encoding for this function.
