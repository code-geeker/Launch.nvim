*xml_set_processing_instruction_handler*

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7, PHP 8)

xml_set_processing_instruction_handler â€” Set up processing instruction (PI)
handler

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  xml_set_processing_instruction_handler(XMLParser $parser,~
  callable|string|null $handler): true~

Sets the processing instruction (PI) handler function for the XML parser
{parser}.

A processing instruction has the following format:

<?target
data
<?>

Caution

PHP code is delimited by the <?php processing instruction. As such it is
possible to have PHP code within an XML document. However, the PI end tag (?>)
must not be part of the data. If a PI end tag exists as part of the embedded
PHP code, the rest of the PHP code and the "real" PI end tag, will be treated
as character data.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{parser}

  The XML parser.

{handler}

  If null is passed, the handler is reset to its default state.
  Warning

  An empty string will also reset the handler, however this is deprecated as of
  PHP 8.4.0.

  If {handler} is a callable, the callable is set as the handler.

  If {handler} is a string, it can be the name of a method of an object set
  with |xml_set_object|.
  Warning

  This is deprecated as of PHP 8.4.0.

  Warning

  As of PHP 8.4.0, the callable is checked to be valid while setting the
  handler, not when it is called. This means that |xml_set_object| must be
  called prior to setting a method string as the callback. However, as this
  behaviour is also deprecated as of PHP 8.4.0, using a proper callable for the
  method is recommended instead.

  The signature of the handler must be:

  handler(XMLParser $parser, string $target, string $data): void~

  {parser}
    The XML parser calling the handler.
  {target}
    The processing instruction target.
  {data}
    The processing instruction data.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

Always returns true.

[ Changelog ]

Version                               Description
8.4.0   Passing a non-callable string to {handler} is now deprecated, use a
        proper callable for methods, or null to reset the handler.
8.4.0   The validity of {handler} as a callable is now checked when setting the
        handler instead of checking when calling it.
8.0.0   {parser} expects an XMLParser instance now; previously, a valid xml 
        resource was expected.
