*filter_input_array*

(PHP 5 >= 5.2.0, PHP 7, PHP 8)

filter_input_array â€” Gets external variables and optionally filters them

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  filter_input_array(int $type, array|int $options = FILTER_DEFAULT, bool~
  $add_empty = true): array|false|null~

This function is useful for retrieving many values without repetitively calling
|filter_input|.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{type}
  One of the INPUT_* constants.
  Warning

  The content of the superglobal that is being filtered is the original "raw"
  content provided by the SAPI, prior to any user modification to the
  superglobal. To filter a modified superglobal use |filter_var_array| instead.

{options}
  Either an associative array of options, or the filter to apply to each entry,
  which can either be a validation filter by using one of the FILTER_VALIDATE_*
  constants, or a sanitization filter by using one of the FILTER_SANITIZE_*
  constants. The option array is an associative array where the key corresponds
  to a key in the data {array} and the associated value is either the filter to
  apply to this entry, or an associative array describing how and which filter
  should be applied to this entry. The associative array describing how a
  filter should be applied must contain the 'filter' key whose associated value
  is the filter to apply, which can be one of the FILTER_VALIDATE_*,
  FILTER_SANITIZE_*, FILTER_UNSAFE_RAW, or FILTER_CALLBACK constants. It can
  optionally contain the 'flags' key which specifies and flags that apply to
  the filter, and the 'options' key which specifies any options that apply to
  the filter.
{add_empty}

  Add missing keys as null to the return value.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

On success, an array containing the values of the requested variables.

On failure, false is returned. Except if the failure is that the input array
designated by {type} is not populated where null is returned if the
FILTER_NULL_ON_FAILURE flag is used.

Missing entries from the input array will be populated into the returned array
if {add_empty} is true. In which case, missing entries will be set to null,
unless the FILTER_NULL_ON_FAILURE flag is used, in which case it will be false.

An entry of the returned array will be false if the filter fails, unless the
FILTER_NULL_ON_FAILURE flag is used, in which case it will be null.

===============================================================================
[ Notes ]

  Note:

  There is no REQUEST_TIME key in INPUT_SERVER array because it is inserted
  into the $_SERVER later.
