dba_popen â€” Open database persistently

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  dba_popen(    string~
  $path,    string $mode,    ?string~
  $handler = null,    int $permission =~
  0644,    int $map_size = 0,    ?int~
  $flags = null): Dba\Connection|false~

dba_popen() establishes a persistent database instance for {path} with {mode}
using {handler}.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{path}

  Commonly a regular path in your filesystem.

{mode}

  It is r for read access, w for read/write access to an already existing
  database, c for read/write access and database creation if it doesn't
  currently exist, and n for create, truncate and read/write access.

{handler}

  The name of the handler which shall be used for accessing {path}. It is
  passed all optional parameters given to dba_popen() and can act on behalf of
  them. If {handler} is null, then the default handler is invoked.

{permission}

  Optional int parameter which is passed to the driver. It has the same meaning
  as the {permissions} parameter of |chmod|, and defaults to 0644.

  The db1, db2, db3, db4, dbm, gdbm, ndbm, and lmdb drivers support the
  {permission} parameter.

{map_size}

  Optional int parameter which is passed to the driver. Its value should be a
  multiple of the page size of the OS, or zero, to use the default mapsize.

  The lmdb driver accepts the {map_size} parameter.

{flags}

  Allows to pass flags to the DB drivers. Currently, only LMDB with
  DBA_LMDB_USE_SUB_DIR and DBA_LMDB_NO_SUB_DIR are supported.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

Returns a Dba\Connection instance on success or false on failure.

===============================================================================
[ Errors/Exceptions ]

false is returned and an E_WARNING level error is issued when {handler} is null
, but there is no default handler.
