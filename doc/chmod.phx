*chmod*

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7, PHP 8)

chmod â€” Changes file mode

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  chmod(string $filename, int $permissions): bool~

Attempts to change the mode of the specified file to that given in
{permissions}.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{filename}

  Path to the file.

{permissions}

  Note that {permissions} is not automatically assumed to be an octal value, so
  to ensure the expected operation, you need to prefix {permissions} with a
  zero (0). Strings such as "g+w" will not work properly.

  <?php >
  chmod("/somedir/somefile", 755); // decimal; probably incorrect
  chmod("/somedir/somefile", "u+rwx,go+rx"); // string; incorrect
  chmod("/somedir/somefile", 0755); // octal; correct value of mode
<  ?>

  The {permissions} parameter consists of three octal number components
  specifying access restrictions for the owner, the user group in which the
  owner is in, and to everybody else in this order. One component can be
  computed by adding up the needed permissions for that target user base.
  Number 1 means that you grant execute rights, number 2 means that you make
  the file writeable, number 4 means that you make the file readable. Add up
  these numbers to specify needed rights. You can also read more about modes on
  Unix systems with '`man` `1` `chmod`' and '`man` `2` `chmod`'.

  <?php >
  // Read and write for owner, nothing for everybody else
  chmod("/somedir/somefile", 0600);

  // Read and write for owner, read for everybody else
  chmod("/somedir/somefile", 0644);

  // Everything for owner, read and execute for others
  chmod("/somedir/somefile", 0755);

  // Everything for owner, read and execute for owner's group
  chmod("/somedir/somefile", 0750);
<  ?>

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

Returns true on success or false on failure.

===============================================================================
[ Errors/Exceptions ]

Upon failure, an E_WARNING is emitted.

===============================================================================
[ Notes ]

  Note:

  The current user is the user under which PHP runs. It is probably not the
  same user you use for normal shell or FTP access. The mode can be changed
  only by user who owns the file on most systems.

  Note: This function will not work on remote files as the file to be examined
  must be accessible via the server's filesystem.
