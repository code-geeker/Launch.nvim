element   type                            description
command  string The command string that was passed to |proc_open|.
pid      int    process id
running  bool   true if the process is still running, false if it has
                terminated.

exitcode int    if running is false). Prior to PHP 8.3.0, only the first call
                of this function returned the real value, the following calls

                subsequent calls to process APIs.
termsig  int    The number of the signal that caused the child process to
                terminate its execution (only meaningful if signaled is true).
stopsig  int    The number of the signal that caused the child process to stop
                its execution (only meaningful if stopped is true).
