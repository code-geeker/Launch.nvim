*ctype_alpha*

(PHP 4 >= 4.0.4, PHP 5, PHP 7, PHP 8)

ctype_alpha â€” Check for alphabetic character(s)

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  ctype_alpha(mixed $text): bool~

Checks if all of the characters in the provided string, {text}, are alphabetic.
In the standard C locale letters are just [A-Za-z] and ctype_alpha() is
equivalent to (ctype_upper($text) || ctype_lower($text)) if $text is just a
single character, but other languages have letters that are considered neither
upper nor lower case.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{text}

  The tested string.


    Note:

    If an int between -128 and 255 inclusive is provided, it is interpreted as
    the ASCII value of a single character (negative values have 256 added in
    order to allow characters in the Extended ASCII range). Any other integer
    is interpreted as a string containing the decimal digits of the integer.

  Warning

  As of PHP 8.1.0, passing a non-string argument is deprecated. In the future,
  the argument will be interpreted as a string instead of an ASCII codepoint.
  Depending on the intended behavior, the argument should either be cast to 
  string or an explicit call to |chr| should be made.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

Returns true if every character in {text} is a letter from the current locale,
false otherwise. When called with an empty string the result will always be
false.

===============================================================================
[ Examples ]

Example #1 A ctype_alpha() example (using the default locale)

<?php >
  $strings = array('KjgWZC', 'arf12');
  foreach ($strings as $testcase) {
  if (ctype_alpha($testcase)) {
  echo "The string $testcase consists of all letters.\n";
  } else {
  echo "The string $testcase does not consist of all letters.\n";
  }
  }
<?>

The above example will output:

The string KjgWZC consists of all letters.
The string arf12 does not consist of all letters.
