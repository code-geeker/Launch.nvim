*pg_lo_create*

(PHP 4 >= 4.2.0, PHP 5, PHP 7, PHP 8)

pg_lo_create â€” Create a large object

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  pg_lo_create(PgSql\Connection $connection = ?, mixed $object_id = ?): int~
  pg_lo_create(mixed $object_id): int~

pg_lo_create() creates a large object and returns the OID of the large object.
PostgreSQL access modes INV_READ, INV_WRITE, and INV_ARCHIVE are not supported,
the object is created always with both read and write access. INV_ARCHIVE has
been removed from PostgreSQL itself (version 6.3 and above).

To use the large object interface, it is necessary to enclose it within a
transaction block.

Instead of using the large object interface (which has no access controls and
is cumbersome to use), try PostgreSQL's bytea column type and |pg_escape_bytea|
.

  Note:

  This function used to be called pg_locreate().

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{connection}

  An PgSql\Connection instance. When {connection} is unspecified, the default
  connection is used. The default connection is the last connection made by 
  |pg_connect| or |pg_pconnect|.
  Warning

  As of PHP 8.1.0, using the default connection is deprecated.

{object_id}

  If an {object_id} is given the function will try to create a large object
  with this id, else a free object id is assigned by the server. The parameter
  relies on functionality that first appeared in PostgreSQL 8.1.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

A large object OID, or false on failure.

[ Changelog ]

Version                               Description
8.1.0   The {connection} parameter expects an PgSql\Connection instance now;
        previously, a resource was expected.
