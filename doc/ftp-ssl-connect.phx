*ftp_ssl_connect*

(PHP 4 >= 4.3.0, PHP 5, PHP 7, PHP 8)

ftp_ssl_connect â€” Opens a Secure SSL-FTP connection

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  ftp_ssl_connect(string $hostname, int $port = 21, int $timeout = 90):~
  FTP\Connection|false~

ftp_ssl_connect() opens an explicit SSL-FTP connection to the specified
{hostname}. That implies that ftp_ssl_connect() will succeed even if the server
is not configured for SSL-FTP. Only when |ftp_login| is called, the client will
send the appropriate AUTH FTP command, so |ftp_login| will fail. The connection
established by ftp_ssl_connect() will not do peer-certificate verification.

  Note: Why this function may not exist

  Before PHP 7.0.0, ftp_ssl_connect() was only available if both the ftp module
  and the OpenSSL support have been built statically into php; this means that
  on Windows this function had been undefined in the official PHP builds. To
  have this function available on Windows, it had been necessary to compile own
  PHP binaries.

  Note:

  ftp_ssl_connect() is not intended for use with sFTP. To use sFTP with PHP,
  please see |ssh2_sftp|.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{hostname}

  The FTP server address. This parameter shouldn't have any trailing slashes
  and shouldn't be prefixed with ftp://.

{port}

  This parameter specifies an alternate port to connect to. If it is omitted or
  set to zero, then the default FTP port, 21, will be used.

{timeout}

  This parameter specifies the timeout for all subsequent network operations.
  If omitted, the default value is 90 seconds. The timeout can be changed and
  queried at any time with |ftp_set_option| and |ftp_get_option|.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

Returns an FTP\Connection instance on success, or false on failure.
