(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7, PHP 8)

ob_implicit_flush â€” Turn implicit flush on/off

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  ob_implicit_flush(bool $enable = true): void~

ob_implicit_flush() will turn implicit flushing on or off. Implicit flushing
will result in a flush operation after every block of code resulting in output,
so that explicit calls to |flush| will no longer be needed.

  Note: Printing empty strings or sending headers is not considered output and
  will not result in a flush operation.

  Note: This function does not have any effect on user level output handlers
  such as those started by |ob_start| or |output_add_rewrite_var|.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{enable}

  true to turn implicit flushing on, false otherwise.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

No value is returned.
