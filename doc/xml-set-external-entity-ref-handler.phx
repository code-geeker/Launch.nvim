*xml_set_external_entity_ref_handler*

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7, PHP 8)

xml_set_external_entity_ref_handler â€” Set up external entity reference handler

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  xml_set_external_entity_ref_handler(XMLParser $parser, callable|string|null~
  $handler): true~

Sets the external entity reference handler function for the XML parser
{parser}.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{parser}

  The XML parser.

{handler}

  If null is passed, the handler is reset to its default state.
  Warning

  An empty string will also reset the handler, however this is deprecated as of
  PHP 8.4.0.

  If {handler} is a callable, the callable is set as the handler.

  If {handler} is a string, it can be the name of a method of an object set
  with |xml_set_object|.
  Warning

  This is deprecated as of PHP 8.4.0.

  Warning

  As of PHP 8.4.0, the callable is checked to be valid while setting the
  handler, not when it is called. This means that |xml_set_object| must be
  called prior to setting a method string as the callback. However, as this
  behaviour is also deprecated as of PHP 8.4.0, using a proper callable for the
  method is recommended instead.

  The signature of the handler must be:

  handler(    XMLParser~
  $parser,    string~
  $open_entity_names,    string|false~
  $base,    string~
  $system_id,    string|false $public_id): bool~

  {parser}
    The XML parser calling the handler.
  {open_entity_names}
    A space-separated list of the names of the entities that are open for the
    parse of this entity (including the name of the referenced entity).
  {base}
    This is the base for resolving the system identifier ({system_id}) of the
    external entity.
  {system_id}
    The system identifier as specified in the entity declaration.
  {public_id}
    The public identifier as specified in the entity declaration, or an empty
    string if none was specified; the whitespace in the public identifier will
    have been normalized as required by the XML spec.

  The handler should return true if the entity was handled, false otherwise.
  When returning false the XML parser will stop parsing and |xml_get_error_code
  | will return XML_ERROR_EXTERNAL_ENTITY_HANDLING.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

Always returns true.

[ Changelog ]

Version                               Description
8.4.0   Passing a non-callable string to {handler} is now deprecated, use a
        proper callable for methods, or null to reset the handler.
8.4.0   The validity of {handler} as a callable is now checked when setting the
        handler instead of checking when calling it.
8.0.0   {parser} expects an XMLParser instance now; previously, a valid xml 
        resource was expected.
        The return value of the {handler} is no longer ignored if the extension
7.3.0   has been built against libxml. Formerly, the return value has been
        ignored, and parsing did never stop.
