*str_ireplace*

(PHP 5, PHP 7, PHP 8)

str_ireplace â€” Case-insensitive version of |str_replace|

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  str_ireplace(    array|string~
  $search,    array|string~
  $replace,    string|array~
  $subject,    int &$count = null): string|array~

This function returns a string or an array with all occurrences of {search} in
{subject} (ignoring case) replaced with the given {replace} value.

To replace text based on a pattern rather than a fixed string, use 
|preg_replace| with the i pattern modifier.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

If {search} and {replace} are arrays, then str_ireplace() takes a value from
each array and uses them to search and replace on {subject}. If {replace} has
fewer values than {search}, then an empty string is used for the rest of
replacement values. If {search} is an array and {replace} is a string, then
this replacement string is used for every value of {search}. The converse would
not make sense, though.

If {search} or {replace} are arrays, their elements are processed first to
last.

{search}

  The value being searched for, otherwise known as the needle. An array may be
  used to designate multiple needles.

{replace}

  The replacement value that replaces found {search} values. An array may be
  used to designate multiple replacements.

{subject}

  The string or array being searched and replaced on, otherwise known as the
  haystack.

  If {subject} is an array, then the search and replace is performed with every
  entry of {subject}, and the return value is an array as well.

{count}

  If passed, this will be set to the number of replacements performed.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

Returns a string or an array of replacements.

[ Changelog ]

Version                               Description
        Case folding no longer depends on the locale set with |setlocale|. Only
8.2.0   ASCII case folding will be done. Non-ASCII bytes will be compared by
        their byte value.

===============================================================================
[ Examples ]

Example #1 str_ireplace() example

<?php >
  $bodytag = str_ireplace("%body%", "black", "<body text=%BODY%>");
  echo $bodytag; // <body text=black>
<?>

===============================================================================
[ Notes ]

  Note: This function is binary-safe.

Caution *Replacement order gotcha*

Because str_ireplace() replaces left to right, it might replace a previously
inserted value when doing multiple replacements. Example #2 in the |str_replace
| documentation demonstrates how this may affect you in practice.
