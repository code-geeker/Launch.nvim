pg_lo_export â€” Export a large object to file

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  pg_lo_export(PgSql\Connection $connection = ?, int $oid, string $pathname):~
  bool~

pg_lo_export() takes a large object in a PostgreSQL database and saves its
contents to a file on the local filesystem.

To use the large object interface, it is necessary to enclose it within a
transaction block.

  Note:

  This function used to be called pg_loexport().

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{connection}

  An PgSql\Connection instance. When {connection} is unspecified, the default
  connection is used. The default connection is the last connection made by 
  |pg_connect| or |pg_pconnect|.
  Warning

  As of PHP 8.1.0, using the default connection is deprecated.

{oid}

  The OID of the large object in the database.

{pathname}

  The full path and file name of the file in which to write the large object on
  the client filesystem.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

Returns true on success or false on failure.
