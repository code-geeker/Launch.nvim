*microtime*

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7, PHP 8)

microtime â€” Return current Unix timestamp with microseconds

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  microtime(bool $as_float = false): string|float~

microtime() returns the current Unix timestamp with microseconds. This function
is only available on operating systems that support the gettimeofday() system
call.

For performance measurements, using |hrtime| is recommended.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{as_float}

  If used and set to true, microtime() will return a float instead of a string,
  as described in the return values section below.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

By default, microtime() returns a string in the form "msec sec", where sec is
the number of seconds since the Unix epoch (0:00:00 January 1,1970 GMT), and
msec measures microseconds that have elapsed since sec and is also expressed in
seconds as a decimal fraction.

If {as_float} is set to true, then microtime() returns a float, which
represents the current time in seconds since the Unix epoch accurate to the
nearest microsecond.

===============================================================================
[ Examples ]

Example #1 Timing script execution

<?php >
  $time_start = microtime(true);

  // Sleep for a while
  usleep(100);

  $time_end = microtime(true);
  $time = $time_end - $time_start;

  echo "Did nothing in $time seconds\n";
<?>

Example #2 microtime() and REQUEST_TIME_FLOAT

<?php >
  // Randomize sleeping time
  usleep(mt_rand(100, 10000));

  // REQUEST_TIME_FLOAT is available in the $_SERVER superglobal array.
  // It contains the timestamp of the start of the request with microsecond
  precision.
  $time = microtime(true) - $_SERVER["REQUEST_TIME_FLOAT"];

  echo "Did nothing in $time seconds\n";
<?>
