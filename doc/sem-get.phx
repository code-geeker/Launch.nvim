*sem_get*

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7, PHP 8)

sem_get â€” Get a semaphore id

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  sem_get(    int $key,    int~
  $max_acquire = 1,    int $permissions =~
  0666,    bool $auto_release = true): SysvSemaphore|false~

sem_get() returns an id that can be used to access the System V semaphore with
the given {key}.

A second call to sem_get() for the same key will return a different semaphore
identifier, but both identifiers access the same underlying semaphore.

If {key} is 0, a new private semaphore is created for each call to sem_get().

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{key}

{max_acquire}

  The number of processes that can acquire the semaphore simultaneously is set
  to {max_acquire}.

{permissions}

  The semaphore permissions. Actually this value is set only if the process
  finds it is the only process currently attached to the semaphore.

{auto_release}

  Specifies if the semaphore should be automatically released on request
  shutdown.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

Returns a positive semaphore identifier on success, or false on error.

[ Changelog ]

Version                               Description
8.0.0   On success, this function returns a SysvSemaphore instance now;
        previously, a resource was returned.
8.0.0   The type of {auto_release} has been changed from int to bool.

===============================================================================
[ Notes ]

Warning

When using sem_get() to access a semaphore created outside PHP, note that the
semaphore must have been created as a set of 3 semaphores (for example, by
specifying 3 as the nsems parameter when calling the C semget() function),
otherwise PHP will be unable to access the semaphore.
