*pg_transaction_status*

(PHP 5 >= 5.1.0, PHP 7, PHP 8)

pg_transaction_status â€” Returns the current in-transaction status of the server

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  pg_transaction_status(PgSql\Connection $connection): int~

Returns the current in-transaction status of the server.

Caution

pg_transaction_status() will give incorrect results when using a PostgreSQL 7.3
server that has the parameter autocommit set to off. The server-side autocommit
feature has been deprecated and does not exist in later server versions.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{connection}

  An PgSql\Connection instance.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

The status can be PGSQL_TRANSACTION_IDLE (currently idle),
PGSQL_TRANSACTION_ACTIVE (a command is in progress), PGSQL_TRANSACTION_INTRANS
(idle, in a valid transaction block), or PGSQL_TRANSACTION_INERROR (idle, in a
failed transaction block). PGSQL_TRANSACTION_UNKNOWN is reported if the
connection is bad. PGSQL_TRANSACTION_ACTIVE is reported only when a query has
been sent to the server and not yet completed.

===============================================================================
[ Changelog ]

Version                               Description
8.1.0   The {connection} parameter expects an PgSql\Connection instance now;
        previously, a resource was expected.
