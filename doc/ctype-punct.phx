*ctype_punct*

(PHP 4 >= 4.0.4, PHP 5, PHP 7, PHP 8)

ctype_punct â€” Check for any printable character which is not whitespace or an
alphanumeric character

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  ctype_punct(mixed $text): bool~

Checks if all of the characters in the provided string, {text}, are punctuation
character.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{text}

  The tested string.


    Note:

    If an int between -128 and 255 inclusive is provided, it is interpreted as
    the ASCII value of a single character (negative values have 256 added in
    order to allow characters in the Extended ASCII range). Any other integer
    is interpreted as a string containing the decimal digits of the integer.

  Warning

  As of PHP 8.1.0, passing a non-string argument is deprecated. In the future,
  the argument will be interpreted as a string instead of an ASCII codepoint.
  Depending on the intended behavior, the argument should either be cast to 
  string or an explicit call to |chr| should be made.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

Returns true if every character in {text} is printable, but neither letter,
digit or blank, false otherwise. When called with an empty string the result
will always be false.

===============================================================================
[ Examples ]

Example #1 A ctype_punct() example

<?php >
  $strings = array('ABasdk!@!$#', '!@ # $', '*&$()');
  foreach ($strings as $testcase) {
  if (ctype_punct($testcase)) {
  echo "The string $testcase consists of all punctuation.\n";
  } else {
  echo "The string $testcase does not consist of all punctuation.\n";
  }
  }
<?>

The above example will output:

The string ABasdk!@!$# does not consist of all punctuation.
The string !@ # $ does not consist of all punctuation.
The string *&$() consists of all punctuation.
