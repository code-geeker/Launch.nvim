*strcspn*

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7, PHP 8)

strcspn â€” Find length of initial segment not matching mask

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  strcspn(    string~
  $string,    string~
  $characters,    int $offset =~
  0,    ?int $length = null): int~

Returns the length of the initial segment of {string} which does not contain
any of the characters in {characters}.

If {offset} and {length} are omitted, then all of {string} will be examined. If
they are included, then the effect will be the same as calling strcspn(substr
($string, $offset, $length), $characters) (see |substr| for more information).

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{string}

  The string to examine.

{characters}

  The string containing every disallowed character.

{offset}

  The position in {string} to start searching.

  If {offset} is given and is non-negative, then strcspn() will begin examining
  {string} at the {offset}'th position. For instance, in the string 'abcdef',
  the character at position 0 is 'a', the character at position 2 is 'c', and
  so forth.

  If {offset} is given and is negative, then strcspn() will begin examining
  {string} at the {offset}'th position from the end of {string}.

{length}

  The length of the segment from {string} to examine.

  If {length} is given and is non-negative, then {string} will be examined for
  {length} characters after the starting position.

  If {length} is given and is negative, then {string} will be examined from the
  starting position up to {length} characters from the end of {string}.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

Returns the length of the initial segment of {string} which consists entirely
of characters not in {characters}.

  Note:

  When a {offset} parameter is set, the returned length is counted starting
  from this position, not from the beginning of {string}.

[ Changelog ]

Version                               Description
8.4.0   Prior to PHP 8.4.0, when {characters} was the empty string, the search
        would incorrectly stop at the first null byte in {string}.
8.0.0   {length} is nullable now.

===============================================================================
[ Examples ]

Example #1 strcspn() example

<?php >
  $a = strcspn('banana', 'a');
  $b = strcspn('banana', 'abcd');
  $c = strcspn('banana', 'z');
  $d = strcspn('abcdhelloabcd', 'a', -9);
  $e = strcspn('abcdhelloabcd', 'a', -9, -5);

  var_dump($a);
  var_dump($b);
  var_dump($c);
  var_dump($d);
  var_dump($e);
<?>

The above example will output:

int(1)
int(0)
int(6)
int(5)
int(4)
