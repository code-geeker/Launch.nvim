===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  array~

Queries the current status for a service, returning an array of information.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{servicename}

  The short name of the service.

{machine}

  The optional machine name. If omitted, the local machine will be used.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

Returns an array consisting of the following information on success

Prior version 1.0.0, false if there is a problem with the parameters or a Win32
Error Code on failure.

{ServiceType}

  The dwServiceType. See Win32Service Service Type Bitmasks.

{CurrentState}

  The dwCurrentState. See Win32Service Service Status Constants.

{ControlsAccepted}

  Which service controls are accepted by the service. See Win32Service Service
  Control Message Accepted Bitmasks.

{Win32ExitCode}

  If the service exited, the return code from the process. This value is equal
  to WIN32_ERROR_SERVICE_SPECIFIC_ERROR if the exit mode is not gracefuly. See
  Win32Service error codes and |win32_set_service_exit_mode|

{ServiceSpecificExitCode}

  If the service exited with an error condition, the service specific code that
  is logged in the event log is visible here. This value is equal to the value
  defined by |win32_set_service_exit_code|

{CheckPoint}

  If the service is shutting down, holds the current check point number. This
  is used by the SCM as a kind of heart-beat to detect a wedged service
  process. The value of the check point is best interpreted in conjunction with
  the WaitHint value.

{WaitHint}

  If the service is shutting down it will set WaitHint to a checkpoint value
  that will indicate 100% completion. This can be used to implement a progress
  indicator.

{ProcessId}

  The Windows process identifier. If 0, the process is not running.

{ServiceFlags}

  The dwServiceFlags. See Win32Service Service Flag Constants.
