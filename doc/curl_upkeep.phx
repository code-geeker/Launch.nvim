*curl_upkeep*

(PHP 8 >= 8.2.0)

curl_upkeep â€” Performs any connection upkeep checks

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  curl_upkeep(CurlHandle $handle): bool~

Available if built against libcurl >= 7.62.0.

Some protocols have "connection upkeep" mechanisms. These mechanisms usually
send some traffic on existing connections in order to keep them alive; this can
prevent connections from being closed due to overzealous firewalls, for
example.

Connection upkeep is currently available only for HTTP/2 connections. A small
amount of traffic is usually sent to keep a connection alive. HTTP/2 maintains
its connection by sending a HTTP/2 PING frame.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{handle}

  A cURL handle returned by |curl_init|.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

Returns true on success or false on failure.
