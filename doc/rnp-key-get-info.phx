      Key         Data                        Description
                  type
"is_primary"     boolean true if this key is the primary key.
"is_sub"         boolean true if this key is a subkey.
                         true if public key is valid. This includes checks of
"is_valid"       boolean the self-signatures, expiration times, revocations and
                         so on.
"is_revoked"     boolean true if this key is revoked.
"is_superseded"  boolean true if this key is superseded. Present only if the
                         key is revoked.
"is_compromised" boolean true if this key is compromised. Present only if the
                         key is revoked.
"is_retired"     boolean true if this key is retired. Present only if the key
                         is revoked.
"is_expired"     boolean true if this key is expired.
"have_secret"    boolean true if this key has secret part.
"is_locked"      boolean true if this key is currently locked. Only present for
                         secret keys.
                         true if this key is protected. Only present for secret
"is_protected"   boolean keys. A protected key is one that is encrypted and can
                         be safely held in memory and locked/unlocked as
                         needed.
"have_public"    boolean true if this key has public part. Generally all keys
                         would have public part.
                         The timestamp till which key can be considered as
                         valid. Note: this will take into account not only
"valid_till"     integer key's expiration, but revocations as well. For the
                         subkey primary key's validity time will be also
                         checked.
"bits"           integer Number of bits in the key. For EC-based keys it will
                         contain size of the curve.
"alg"            string  Key algorithm name.
                         An indexed array containing fingerprint strings of
"subkeys"        array   subkeys. Only present for primary keys. Could be empty
                         if primary key has no subkeys.
                         An indexed array containing user ID strings. Only
"uids"           array   present for primary keys. Could be empty if primary
                         key has no user ID-s.
