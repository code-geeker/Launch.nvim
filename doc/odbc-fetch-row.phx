(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7, PHP 8)

odbc_fetch_row â€” Fetch a row

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  odbc_fetch_row(Odbc\Result $statement, ?int $row = null): bool~

Fetches a row of the data that was returned by |odbc_do| or |odbc_exec|. After 
odbc_fetch_row() is called, the fields of that row can be accessed with 
|odbc_result|.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{statement}

  The ODBC result object.

{row}

  If {row} is not specified, odbc_fetch_row() will try to fetch the next row in
  the result set. Calls to odbc_fetch_row() with and without {row} can be
  mixed.

  To step through the result more than once, you can call odbc_fetch_row() with
  {row} 1, and then continue doing odbc_fetch_row() without {row} to review the
  result. If a driver doesn't support fetching rows by number, the {row}
  parameter is ignored.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

Returns true if there was a row, false otherwise.

===============================================================================
[ Errors/Exceptions ]

An E_WARNING is emitted when {row} is equal or less than zero.
