*strstr*

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7, PHP 8)

strstr â€” Find the first occurrence of a string

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  strstr(string $haystack, string $needle, bool $before_needle = false):~
  string|false~

Returns part of {haystack} string starting from and including the first
occurrence of {needle} to the end of {haystack}.

  Note:

  This function is case-sensitive. For case-insensitive searches, use |stristr|
  .

  Note:

  If it is only required to determine if a particular {needle} occurs within
  {haystack}, the faster and less memory intensive |str_contains| function
  should be used instead.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{haystack}

  The input string.

{needle}

  The string to search for.

  Prior to PHP 8.0.0, if {needle} is not a string, it is converted to an
  integer and applied as the ordinal value of a character. This behavior is
  deprecated as of PHP 7.3.0, and relying on it is highly discouraged.
  Depending on the intended behavior, the {needle} should either be explicitly
  cast to string, or an explicit call to |chr| should be performed.

{before_needle}

  If true, strstr() returns the part of the {haystack} before the first
  occurrence of the {needle} (excluding the needle).

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

Returns the portion of string, or false if {needle} is not found.
