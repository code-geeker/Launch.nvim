*gmmktime*

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7, PHP 8)

gmmktime â€” Get Unix timestamp for a GMT date

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  gmmktime(    int $hour,    ?int~
  $minute = null,    ?int $second =~
  null,    ?int $month = null,    ?int~
  $day = null,    ?int $year = null): int|false~

Identical to |mktime| except the passed parameters represents a GMT date. 
gmmktime() internally uses |mktime| so only times valid in derived local time
can be used.

Like |mktime|, optional arguments may be left out in order from right to left,
with any omitted arguments being set to the current corresponding GMT value.

Calling gmmktime() without any arguments is not supported, and will result in
an ArgumentCountError. |time| can be used to get the current timestamp.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{hour}

  The number of the hour relative to the start of the day determined by
  {month}, {day} and {year}. Negative values reference the hour before midnight
  of the day in question. Values greater than 23 reference the appropriate hour
  in the following day(s).

{minute}

  The number of the minute relative to the start of the {hour}. Negative values
  reference the minute in the previous hour. Values greater than 59 reference
  the appropriate minute in the following hour(s).

{second}

  The number of seconds relative to the start of the {minute}. Negative values
  reference the second in the previous minute. Values greater than 59 reference
  the appropriate second in the following minute(s).

{month}

  The number of the month relative to the end of the previous year. Values 1 to
  12 reference the normal calendar months of the year in question. Values less
  than 1 (including negative values) reference the months in the previous year
  in reverse order, so 0 is December, -1 is November, etc. Values greater than
  12 reference the appropriate month in the following year(s).

{day}

  The number of the day relative to the end of the previous month. Values 1 to
  28, 29, 30 or 31 (depending upon the month) reference the normal days in the
  relevant month. Values less than 1 (including negative values) reference the
  days in the previous month, so 0 is the last day of the previous month, -1 is
  the day before that, etc. Values greater than the number of days in the
  relevant month reference the appropriate day in the following month(s).

{year}

  The year

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

Returns a int Unix timestamp on success, or false if the timestamp doesn't fit
in a PHP integer.

8.0.0   {hour} is no longer optional. If you need a Unix timestamp, use |time|.
8.0.0   {minute}, {second}, {month}, {day} and {year} are nullable now.
