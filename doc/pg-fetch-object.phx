*pg_fetch_object*

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7, PHP 8)

pg_fetch_object â€” Fetch a row as an object

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  pg_fetch_object(    PgSql\Result~
  $result,    ?int $row =~
  null,    string $class =~
  "stdClass",    array $constructor_args = []):~
  object|false~

pg_fetch_object() returns an object with properties that correspond to the
fetched row's field names. It can optionally instantiate an object of a
specific class, and pass parameters to that class's constructor.

  Note: This function sets NULL fields to the PHP null value.

Speed-wise, the function is identical to |pg_fetch_array|, and almost as fast
as |pg_fetch_row| (the difference is insignificant).

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{result}

  An PgSql\Result instance, returned by |pg_query|, |pg_query_params| or 
  |pg_execute|(among others).

{row}

  Row number in result to fetch. Rows are numbered from 0 upwards. If omitted
  or null, the next row is fetched.

{class}

  The name of the class to instantiate, set the properties of and return. If
  not specified, a stdClass object is returned.

{constructor_args}

  An optional array of parameters to pass to the constructor for {class}
  objects.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

An object with one attribute for each field name in the result. Database NULL
values are returned as null.

false is returned if {row} exceeds the number of rows in the set, there are no
more rows, or on any other error.

===============================================================================
[ Errors/Exceptions ]

A ValueError is thrown when the {constructor_args} is non-empty with the class
not having constructor.

[ Changelog ]

Version                               Description
        Now throws a ValueError exception when the {constructor_args} is
8.3.0   non-empty with the class not having constructor; previously an 
        Exception was thrown.
8.1.0   The {result} parameter expects an PgSql\Result instance now;
        previously, a resource was expected.

Example #1 pg_fetch_object() example

<?php >

  $database = "store";

  $db_conn = pg_connect("host=localhost port=5432 dbname=$database");
  if (!$db_conn) {
  echo "Failed connecting to postgres database $database\n";
  exit;
  }

  $qu = pg_query($db_conn, "SELECT * FROM books ORDER BY author");


  while ($data = pg_fetch_object($qu)) {
  echo $data->author . " (";
  echo $data->year . "): ";
  echo $data->title . "<br />";
  }

  pg_free_result($qu);
  pg_close($db_conn);
