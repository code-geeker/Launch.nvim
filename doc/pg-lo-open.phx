[ Description ]

  pg_lo_open(PgSql\Connection $connection, int $oid, string $mode):~
  PgSql\Lob|false~

pg_lo_open() opens a large object in the database and returns an PgSql\Lob
instance so that it can be manipulated.

Warning

transaction block.

{oid}

  The OID of the large object in the database.

{mode}
