*file_exists*

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7, PHP 8)

file_exists â€” Checks whether a file or directory exists

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  file_exists(string $filename): bool~

Checks whether a file or directory exists.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{filename}

  Path to the file or directory.

  On windows, use //computername/share/filename or \\computername\share\
  filename to check files on network shares.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

Returns true if the file or directory specified by {filename} exists; false
otherwise.

  Note:

  This function will return false for symlinks pointing to non-existing files.

  Note:

  The check is done using the real UID/GID instead of the effective one.

  Note: Because PHP's integer type is signed and many platforms use 32bit
  integers, some filesystem functions may return unexpected results for files
  which are larger than 2GB.

===============================================================================
[ Errors/Exceptions ]

Upon failure, an E_WARNING is emitted.

===============================================================================
[ Examples ]

Example #1 Testing whether a file exists

<?php >
  $filename = '/path/to/foo.txt';

  if (file_exists($filename)) {
  echo "The file $filename exists";
  } else {
  echo "The file $filename does not exist";
  }
<?>

===============================================================================
[ Notes ]

  Note: The results of this function are cached. See |clearstatcache| for more
  details.

Tip

As of PHP 5.0.0, this function can also be used with some URL wrappers. Refer
to Supported Protocols and Wrappers to determine which wrappers support |stat|
family of functionality.
